2. Discuss:<br>
(a) Is garbage disposal the responsibility only of the government?<br>
(b) Is it possible to reduce the problems relating to disposal of garbage?<br>
Ans:<br>

(b) It is possible to reduce the problems relating to disposal of garbage, if we adopt the following means:<br>
(i) The garbage should be thrown at proper places. It should not be thrown ‘ on streets, roads, parks, etc.<br>
(ii) The part of the garbage that can be reused should be separated from the one that cannot be used. The non-useful components should be disposed off at landfil<br>l areas.
(iii) Follow the rule of Three R’s:<br>
A. Reduce: Use the things in minimum amount which is necessary to fulfil your requirement.<br>
B. Recycle: The things such as plastic, paper, glass and metals separated from the garbage may be recycle to make new things instead of dumping them along with other wastes.<br>

5. (a) Collect different kinds of packaging material. What was the purpose for which each one mas used? Discuss in groups.<br>
(b) Give an example in which packaging could have been reduced.<br>
(c) Write a story on how packaging increases the amount of garbage.<br>
Ans:<br>
(a) Packaging materials like thermocole, foam sheets, paper cuttings, card board, jute are used to protect the articles.Card boxes, plastic containers and tin containers are used to facilitate transportation of the packed materials.<br>
(b) Packaging of toys, clothes, shoes, chocolates can be reduced.<br>
(c) We use packaging materials to protect the articles and also to make package good- looking. For example, to give a gift on birthday, the gift is packed and wrapped in a shiny paper or plastic-coated paper. After use the packing material is thrown in dustbin. Similarly, plastic bags, cans, aluminium foils, plastic or aluminium cans and other packaging materials are used and thrown out after use.<br>
Many things such as ghee, refined oil, soaps, detergents and most of eatable goods are sold in small packets.<br>
All the above said measures can help in reducing the amount of garbage due to packing.<br>

6. Do you think it is better to use compost instead of chemical fertilisers? Why?<br>
Ans:  Because:<br><br>
Compost is eco-friendly and harmless. It maintains the texture and fertility of the soil.Chemical fertilisers destroy the natural composition of soil and have adverse effect on human health.<br>
Composting helps in recycling of matter and also in disposal of garbage. Leaching of chemical fertilisers causes water pollution and death of aquatic organisms.<br>
The production of compost is easy, cheap and harmless whereas production of chemical fertilisers is costly and problematic.<br>
