3. Why can a pace or a footstep not be used as a standard unit of length?<br>
Ans: Because a pace or a footstep of each and every person is not equal.<br>

4. Arrange the following lengths in their increasing magnitude :<br>
1 metre, 1 centimetre, 1 kilometre, 1 millimetre.<br>
Ans: Ascending order of length:<br>
1 millimetre < 1 centimetre < 1 metre < 1 kilometre<br>

5. The height of a person is 1.65 m. Express it in cm and mm.<br>
Ans:<br>
(a) 1.65 m, as one metre = 100 cm<br>
= 1.65 x 100 cm = 165 cm<br>
(b)65 x 100 x 10 mm = 1650 mm.<br>

6. The distance between Radha’s home and her school is 3250 ,m. Express this distance in km.<br>
Ans:<br><img src="img00000.png" width="430" length="430">

7. While measuring the length of a knitting needle, the reading of the scale at one  end is 3.0 cm and at the other end is 33.1 cm. What is the length of the needle?<br>
Ans:  Length of the needle = 33.1 cm – 3.0 cm = 30.1 cm.<br>

8. Write the similarities and differences between the motion of a bicycle and a ceiling fan that has been switched on.<br>
Ans: <br>
(i) Similarity: Both the wheel of a bicycle and a ceiling fan exhibit motion on a fixed axis.<br>
(ii) Dissimilarity: Bicycle moves forward thus executes rectilinear motion but fan does not show such motion.<br>

9. Why could you not use an elastic measuring tape to measure distance? What would be some of the problems you would meet in telling someone about a distance you measured with an elastic tape?<br>
Ans:  An elastic measuring tape gives incorrect length of the distance between two points.<br>
Reasons:
(i) The length of the elastic tape varies and depends upon the force by which it is stretched.<br>
(ii) Measurement would vary between 2 or 3 readings even when measured by the same person and by the same elastic tape.<br>
(iii) Measurement would also vary if different persons measure the same distance.<br>

10. Give two examples of periodic motion.<br>
Ans:<br>
(i) Oscillations of a pendulum.<br>
(ii) Motion of swing/motion of earth round the sun.<br>
